Evaluate the following answer based on these four criteria. Be strict and objective.

Score each criterion from 0.0 (poor) to 1.0 (excellent):

- faithfulness: How well-supported is the answer by the provided sources? (Penalize hallucinations heavily)
- relevance: How directly and precisely does the answer address the original query?
- completeness: Does the answer cover all key aspects of the query without major omissions?
- clarity: How clear, professional, concise, and easy to understand is the language?

Also provide:
- overall_score: Weighted average of the four scores (0.0–1.0)
- feedback: One short, constructive sentence explaining the main strength or weakness

Output ONLY a valid JSON object in this exact format:
