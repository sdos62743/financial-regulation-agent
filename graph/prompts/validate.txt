2) Before rejecting a citation, check if the cited URL appears in any source (match by path, e.g. /9067-25). If it does, the citation is VALID.
3) Paraphrasing is OK if meaning is preserved.
4) {retry_note}
5) For "latest" / "most recent" queries:
   - VALID: "most recent among the provided documents" if the response cites a document that appears newest in the sources.
   - INVALID: claiming it is the regulator's globally most recent publication unless sources explicitly show that.
